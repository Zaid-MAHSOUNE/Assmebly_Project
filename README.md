# Assmebly_Project

## Getting Started
This program manages user data using NASM for 32-bit architecture. Follow the steps below to compile and link the assembly code (project.asm):

## **Compiling and Linking:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing project.asm.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     nasm -f elf32 -g -F dwarf project.asm -o project.o
     ld -m elf_i386 project.o -o executable
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - `nasm`: NASM assembler command.
     - `-f elf32`: Specifies 32-bit ELF architecture.
     - `-g`: Includes debugging symbols in the object file.
     - `-F dwarf`: Specifies DWARF debugging information format.
     - `project.asm`: Input assembly code file.
     - `-o project.o`: Output filename for the object file.
     - `ld`: Linker command.
     - `-m elf_i386`: Specifies 32-bit Intel x86 architecture.
     - `project.o`: Object file created by NASM.
     - `-o executable`: Output filename for the final executable file.

## **Debugging (Optional):**
1. Initial Setup:
    - `layout asm`: Sets the GDB display layout to show assembly code alongside other information.
    - `layout regs`: Displays the register values in the layout.
    - `set disassembly-flavor intel`: Specifies that you want to disassemble the code in Intel syntax (common for x86 architecture).

2. Loading the Program:
    - `file executable`: Loads the executable file (generated by NASM) into GDB for debugging.

3. Debugging Commands:
    - `step`: Executes the next instruction in the program, stepping through line by line.
    - `break [line]`: Sets a breakpoint at the specified line number in the assembly code. Execution will pause when it reaches that line.
    - `delete [breakpoint_number]`: Removes the breakpoint with the given number.
    - `info breakpoint`: Lists all currently set breakpoints and their information.
    - `print (casting)[variable-name]`: Prints the value of a variable after potentially casting it to a specific data type. Casting ensures GDB interprets the value correctly.
    - `display (casting)[variable-name]`: Continuously displays the value of a variable and updates it as the program executes. Casting is again helpful for proper interpretation.

## Program Usage
Upon running project.asm, you'll encounter a menu with the following options:

1. Create User
2. Display All Users
3. Display User by ID
4. Display Youngest User
5. Quit

**Input Requirements:**
- Enter a number between 1 and 5 corresponding to your desired action.
- Any other input will trigger an "Invalid Input" message.

**Specific Actions:**
- **Create User:** Enter the user's name and age separated by a space.
- **Display All Users:** View all created users.
- **Display User by ID:** Enter the user's ID to display their details.
- **Display Youngest User:** View the youngest user's details.
- **Quit:** Exit the program.

**Exceptions:**
- The program handles invalid input and user data scenarios with appropriate error messages.

## Memory Management
- User data is stored in two string arrays: `name_array` and `age_array`.
- User IDs are implicit and determined by the position within the arrays.
- Main loop manages user actions and displays the menu.
- User actions include creating users, displaying user information, and quitting.
